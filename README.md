# Brawl-Stars-Ultimate-RPC
Discord RPC for Brawl Stars written in python. Made by @kubune

This project was quick to create. THE PROJECT IS STILL IN BETA

# How to use
1. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in console to install required packages.
2. Configure `config.json` file. Change the player tag and api key token. You can get it from `developer.brawlstars.com`. Make sure to create a token with your IP Address.
3. Open Discord (if you haven't already) and start the project using `python start.py` in the console.
4. Enjoy!

# Issues
If you'll find any issues, feel free to open issue. I'll try to reply and help or fix the issue as fast as possible.

# Customization
If you know Python, you can create your own activity by creating a new python file in `src/presets` and then importing the class in `presets.py`. When you'll start the RPC, it will create a `data.json` file. You can use it to give any values you want and thus create a custom activity. I'll try to update the project to have more presets but you can open a Pull Request to add your own one!

### This project runs thanks to Brawlify's BrawlAPI, Official Brawl Stars API and HPDEVFOX API.
